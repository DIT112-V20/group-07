WHAT?
Our idea is to create a delivery service. The deliveries will be handled by an autonomously driving car that can be tracked on the customers phone by an application that will be part of our system. 
The application will show the customer:
  1. The current location of the delivery vehicle. 
  2. The delivery route.
  3. The destination i.e. the customers chosen drop of point.
  4. Estimated time of arrival.

WHY?
To make it easier for customers to get deliveries, an autonomous delivery system do not have the constraints that a system using a human driver would have, so deliveries can be made whenever the customer desires. Also making delivery of expensive wares safer, since during transport no human interaction will be necessary other than that of the customer.

HOW?
The basic concept is that we would have a car that is able to interact with a map via GPS: The car could either remote controlled or semi-autonomous in the beginning, but  it would be able to send its information via gps and trace its itinerary on some kind of real map. If we manage to do that, we would then try to make the car as autonomous as possible. The final step would be to be able to select a point on a map and the car would be able to drive to it itself, but the idea is that our project would still hold even if we fail to accomplish that. 
I would also add that the bigger purpose of this idea is to be integrated into some kind of delivery system.
