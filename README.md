## Project
### WHAT?
We will create a last-mile delivery service. The deliveries will be handled by an autonomous car that can be tracked on an interface  that will be part of our system. 

The application will show the customer:
  1. The current location of the delivery vehicle. 
  2. The delivery route.
  3. The destination i.e. the customers chosen drop-off point.
  4. Estimated time of arrival.

### WHY?
To make it easier for customers to get deliveries, since an autonomous delivery system does not have the constraints that a system using a human driver has, so deliveries can be made whenever the customer desires. Also making delivery of expensive goods  safer since, during transport, no human interaction will be necessary other than that of the customer.

### HOW?
We plan on using the following technologies to complete this project: 
- the Arduino IDE and the Smart Car Shield library to control the car
- Sensors to be able to detect obstacles in the car’s path
- Something similar to the GPRS+GPS Quadband Module for Arduino to track the localisation of the car
- Android studio or something similar to create the application that is able to track the localisation of the car.
